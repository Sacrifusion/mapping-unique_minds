# Mapping the Unique Mind — A Pre-Diagnostic Insight Tool

This project aims to provide an intuitive, empowering self-assessment tool to help cognitive outliers—particularly those with ADHD-like traits—map their thinking style before formal diagnosis or breakdown.

## Purpose

To:
- Recognize emergent cognitive traits
- Offer insight without labels
- Enable nonlinear, low-friction completion
- Validate difference without deficit framing

## Key Concepts

- **Insight Before Label**
- **Nonlinear Engagement**
- **Empowerment Over Pathology**
- **Front-Loaded Signal Questions**
